What is left to do for healthmonger?
====================================

Support for other data sets
---------------------------

The design of the API supports multiple data sources or tables. Currently, only
personal heath care (PHC) spending by age and gender is supported.


Integrate with visualization tool
---------------------------------

Chooseâ€‹ a data set from the CMS National Health Expenditure Data Sets (can be the same as above) and use visualization tools (Bokeh preferred, matplotlib, other?) to create an interesting analysis of the results.


Use python notebook for an example integration.


Generate documentation automatically
------------------------------------

Currently there is no automatic documentation. Automating this prevents documentation from becoming stale and useless.


Make more configurable
----------------------
There are parts that are not as flexible as they should be.


Remove XXX
----------

There are places of note where we need to fix potential issues in the code.


Improve API discovery
---------------------

The discovery and example option is not ideal.


Add more tests
--------------

Always good to have tests!
